## Idea of the project:
To showcase the capabilities of the Napptive platform and demonstrate how to use OAM to define and deploy a custom application. 
To deliver easy-to-deploy tools at one click

## Impact of the project:
By using the Open Application Model (OAM) specification and Napptive's platform, the project enables developers to define, deploy, and manage applications in a more efficient and streamlined manner.
Making it easier for developers to create cloud-native applications that can run on any Kubernetes cluster.

## What did we learn:
How to use the Napptive platform to deploy a custom application using the Open Application Model (OAM) specification.
The benefits of using OAM to manage applications, including the ability to abstract application deployment details from the underlying infrastructure.

> Note: Users can follow the instructions in the documentation to create their own custom application and deploy it to the Napptive platform.
